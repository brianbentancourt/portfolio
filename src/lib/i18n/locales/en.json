I've been in the field for about 5 years, and approximately 3 years ago, due to the pandemic, I was forced to organize my clientele. Until then, I worked on a first-come, first-served basis, often having 5 to 8 people waiting in the shop. I started using methods like WhatsApp reservations, but I still couldn't find a solution for order and efficiency, as I had to be attentive to the phone while serving clients. Thanks to Brian Bentancourt, I found the solution to my problem. He designed a web scheduling application through which clients can book themselves, allowing me to work peacefully without being tied to the phone. Today, a little over a year after the pandemic, I continue to work the same way, as the web application was very well received by clients and proved to be a solution for me, also being an innovation in my field."

We acquired these services at a difficult time for our company, where we managed them manually and archaically, leading to absurd delays, which clearly made us lose more customers. Thanks to the implementation of an IT system, extremely easy to use and with all the features we needed, today we manage our orders efficiently, obtaining better results and therefore more customers. I recommend everyone to hire Brian Bentancourt's services, excellent quality, professionalism, and a fair price!"
